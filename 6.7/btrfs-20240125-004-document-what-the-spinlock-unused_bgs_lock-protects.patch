Subject: [PATCH 4/5] btrfs: document what the spinlock unused_bgs_lock protects
Date: Thu, 25 Jan 2024 10:26:27 +0000

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

Add some comments to struct btrfs_fs_info to explicitly document which
members are protected by the spinlock unused_bgs_lock. It is currently
used to protect two linked lists, the reclaim_bgs and unused_bgs lists.

So add an explicit comment on top of each list to mention its protected
by unused_bgs_lock, as well as comment on top of unused_bgs_lock to
mention the lists it protects.
