Subject: [PATCH 2/2] btrfs: unexport btrfs_prev_leaf()
Date:   Wed, 12 Apr 2023 11:33:10 +0100

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

btrfs_prev_leaf() is not used outside ctree.c, so there's no need to
export it at ctree.h - just make it static at ctree.c and move its
definition above btrfs_search_slot_for_read(), since that function
calls it.
