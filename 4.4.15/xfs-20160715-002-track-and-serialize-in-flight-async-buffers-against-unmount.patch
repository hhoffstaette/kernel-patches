Subject: [PATCH v2 2/2] xfs: track and serialize in-flight async buffers against unmount
Date: Fri, 15 Jul 2016 14:35:34 -0400

Newly allocated XFS metadata buffers are added to the LRU once the hold
count is released, which typically occurs after I/O completion. There is
no other mechanism at current that tracks the existence or I/O state of
a new buffer. Further, readahead I/O tends to be submitted
asynchronously by nature, which means the I/O can remain in flight and
actually complete long after the calling context is gone. This means
that file descriptors or any other holds on the filesystem can be
released, allowing the filesystem to be unmounted while I/O is still in
flight. When I/O completion occurs, core data structures may have been
freed, causing completion to run into invalid memory accesses and likely
to panic.

This problem is reproduced on XFS via directory readahead. A filesystem
is mounted, a directory is opened/closed and the filesystem immediately
unmounted. The open/close cycle triggers a directory readahead that if
delayed long enough, runs buffer I/O completion after the unmount has
completed.

To address this problem, add a mechanism to track all in-flight,
asynchronous buffers using per-cpu counters in the buftarg. The buffer
is accounted on the first I/O submission after the current reference is
acquired and unaccounted once the buffer is returned to the LRU or
freed. Update xfs_wait_buftarg() to wait on all in-flight I/O before
walking the LRU list. Once in-flight I/O has completed and the workqueue
has drained, all new buffers should have been released onto the LRU.
