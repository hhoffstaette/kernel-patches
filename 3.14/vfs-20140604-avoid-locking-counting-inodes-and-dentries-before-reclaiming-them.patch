Subject: fs/superblock: avoid locking counting inodes and dentries before reclaiming them

We remove the call to grab_super_passive in call to super_cache_count.
This becomes a scalability bottleneck as multiple threads are trying to do
memory reclamation, e.g.  when we are doing large amount of file read and
page cache is under pressure.  The cached objects quickly got reclaimed
down to 0 and we are aborting the cache_scan() reclaim.  But counting
creates a log jam acquiring the sb_lock.

We are holding the shrinker_rwsem which ensures the safety of call to
list_lru_count_node() and s_op->nr_cached_objects.  The shrinker is
unregistered now before ->kill_sb() so the operation is safe when we are
doing unmount.

The impact will depend heavily on the machine and the workload but for a
small machine using postmark tuned to use 4xRAM size the results were
