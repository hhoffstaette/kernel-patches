Subject: [PATCH v7] mm: Proactive compaction
Date: Mon, 15 Jun 2020 07:36:14 -0700

For some applications, we need to allocate almost all memory as
hugepages. However, on a running system, higher-order allocations can
fail if the memory is fragmented. Linux kernel currently does on-demand
compaction as we request more hugepages, but this style of compaction
incurs very high latency. Experiments with one-time full memory
compaction (followed by hugepage allocations) show that kernel is able
to restore a highly fragmented memory state to a fairly compacted memory
state within <1 sec for a 32G system. Such data suggests that a more
proactive compaction can help us allocate a large fraction of memory as
hugepages keeping allocation latencies low.

For a more proactive compaction, the approach taken here is to define a
new sysctl called 'vm.compaction_proactiveness' which dictates bounds
for external fragmentation which kcompactd tries to maintain.

The tunable takes a value in range [0, 100], with a default of 20.

Note that a previous version of this patch [1] was found to introduce
too many tunables (per-order extfrag{low, high}), but this one reduces
them to just one sysctl. Also, the new tunable is an opaque value
instead of asking for specific bounds of "external fragmentation", which
would have been difficult to estimate. The internal interpretation of
this opaque value allows for future fine-tuning.

Currently, we use a simple translation from this tunable to [low, high]
"fragmentation score" thresholds (low=100-proactiveness, high=low+10%).
The score for a node is defined as weighted mean of per-zone external
fragmentation. A zone's present_pages determines its weight.

To periodically check per-node score, we reuse per-node kcompactd
threads, which are woken up every 500 milliseconds to check the same. If
a node's score exceeds its high threshold (as derived from user-provided
proactiveness value), proactive compaction is started until its score
reaches its low threshold value. By default, proactiveness is set to 20,
which implies threshold values of low=80 and high=90.

This patch is largely based on ideas from Michal Hocko [2]. See also the
LWN article [3].

Performance data
================

System: x64_64, 1T RAM, 80 CPU threads.
Kernel: 5.6.0-rc3 + this patch

echo madvise | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
echo madvise | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag

Before starting the driver, the system was fragmented from a userspace
program that allocates all memory and then for each 2M aligned section,
frees 3/4 of base pages using munmap. The workload is mainly anonymous
userspace pages, which are easy to move around. I intentionally avoided
unmovable pages in this test to see how much latency we incur when
hugepage allocations hit direct compaction.

1. Kernel hugepage allocation latencies

With the system in such a fragmented state, a kernel driver then
allocates as many hugepages as possible and measures allocation
latency:

(all latency values are in microseconds)

- With vanilla 5.6.0-rc3

  percentile latency
  –––––––––– –––––––
	   5    7894
	  10    9496
	  25   12561
	  30   15295
	  40   18244
	  50   21229

	  75   30147
	  80   31047
	  90   32859
	  95   33799

Total 2M hugepages allocated = 383859 (749G worth of hugepages out of
762G total free => 98% of free memory could be allocated as hugepages)

- With 5.6.0-rc3 + this patch, with proactiveness=20

sysctl -w vm.compaction_proactiveness=20

  percentile latency
  –––––––––– –––––––

	  10       2

	  30       3
	  40       3
	  50       4
	  60       4
	  75       4
	  80       4
	  90       5
	  95     429

Total 2M hugepages allocated = 384105 (750G worth of hugepages out of
762G total free => 98% of free memory could be allocated as hugepages)

2. JAVA heap allocation

In this test, we first fragment memory using the same method as for (1).

Then, we start a Java process with a heap size set to 700G and request
the heap to be allocated with THP hugepages. We also set THP to madvise
to allow hugepage backing of this heap.

/usr/bin/time
 java -Xms700G -Xmx700G -XX:+UseTransparentHugePages -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch

The above command allocates 700G of Java heap using hugepages.

- With vanilla 5.6.0-rc3

17.39user 1666.48system 27:37.89elapsed

- With 5.6.0-rc3 + this patch, with proactiveness=20

8.35user 194.58system 3:19.62elapsed

Elapsed time remains around 3:15, as proactiveness is further increased.

Note that proactive compaction happens throughout the runtime of these
workloads. The situation of one-time compaction, sufficient to supply
hugepages for following allocation stream, can probably happen for more
extreme proactiveness values, like 80 or 90.

In the above Java workload, proactiveness is set to 20. The test starts
with a node's score of 80 or higher, depending on the delay between the
fragmentation step and starting the benchmark, which gives more-or-less
time for the initial round of compaction. As t	he benchmark consumes
hugepages, node's score quickly rises above the high threshold (90) and
proactive compaction starts again, which brings down the score to the
low threshold level (80).  Repeat.

bpftrace also confirms proactive compaction running 20+ times during the
runtime of this Java benchmark. kcompactd threads consume 100% of one of
the CPUs while it tries to bring a node's score within thresholds.

Backoff behavior
================

Above workloads produce a memory state which is easy to compact.
However, if memory is filled with unmovable pages, proactive compaction
should essentially back off. To test this aspect:

- Created a kernel driver that allocates almost all memory as hugepages
  followed by freeing first 3/4 of each hugepage.
- Set proactiveness=40
- Note that proactive_compact_node() is deferred maximum number of times
  with HPAGE_FRAG_CHECK_INTERVAL_MSEC of wait between each check
  (=> ~30 seconds between retries).

Changelog v7 vs v6:
 - Fix compile error while THP is disabled (Oleksandr)

Changelog v6 vs v5:
 - Fallback to HUGETLB_PAGE_ORDER if HPAGE_PMD_ORDER is not defined, and
   some cleanups (Vlastimil)
 - Cap min threshold to avoid excess compaction load in case user sets
   extreme values like 100 for `vm.compaction_proactiveness` sysctl (Khalid)
 - Add some more explanation about the effect of tunable on compaction
   behavior in user guide (Khalid)

Changelog v5 vs v4:
 - Change tunable from sysfs to sysctl (Vlastimil)
 - Replace HUGETLB_PAGE_ORDER with HPAGE_PMD_ORDER (Vlastimil)
 - Minor cleanups (remove redundant initializations, ...)

Changelog v4 vs v3:
 - Document various functions.
 - Added admin-guide for the new tunable `proactiveness`.
 - Rename proactive_compaction_score to fragmentation_score for clarity.

Changelog v3 vs v2:
 - Make proactiveness a global tunable and not per-node. Also upadated
the
   patch description to reflect the same (Vlastimil Babka).
 - Don't start proactive compaction if kswapd is running (Vlastimil
Babka).
 - Clarified in the description that compaction runs in parallel with
   the workload, instead of a one-time compaction followed by a stream
of
   hugepage allocations.

Changelog v2 vs v1:
 - Introduce per-node and per-zone "proactive compaction score". This
   score is compared against watermarks which are set according to
   user provided proactiveness value.
 - Separate code-paths for proactive compaction from targeted compaction
   i.e. where pgdat->kcompactd_max_order is non-zero.
 - Renamed hpage_compaction_effort -> proactiveness. In future we may
   use more than extfrag wrt hugepage size to determine proactive
   compaction score.

+compaction_proactiveness
+========================
+
+This tunable takes a value in the range [0, 100] with a default value of
+20. This tunable determines how aggressively compaction is done in the
+background. Setting it to 0 disables proactive compaction.
+
+Note that compaction has a non-trivial system-wide impact as pages
+belonging to different processes are moved around, which could also lead
+to latency spikes in unsuspecting applications. The kernel employs
+various heuristics to avoid wasting CPU cycles if it detects that
+proactive compaction is not being effective.
+
+Be careful when setting it to extreme values like 100, as that may
+cause excessive background compaction activity.
