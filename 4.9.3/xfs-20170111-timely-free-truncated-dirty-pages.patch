Subject: xfs: Timely free truncated dirty pages
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Commit 99579ccec4e2 "xfs: skip dirty pages in ->releasepage()" started
to skip dirty pages in xfs_vm_releasepage() which also has the effect
that if a dirty page is truncated, it does not get freed by
block_invalidatepage() and is lingering in LRU list waiting for reclaim.
So a simple loop like:

while true; do
	dd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=1M count=100
	rm file
done

will keep using more and more memory until we hit low watermarks and
start pagecache reclaim which will eventually reclaim also the truncate
pages. Keeping these truncated (and thus never usable) pages in memory
is just a waste of memory, is unnecessarily stressing page cache
reclaim, and reportedly also leads to anonymous mmap(2) returning ENOMEM
prematurely.

So instead of just skipping dirty pages in xfs_vm_releasepage(), return
to old behavior of skipping them only if they have delalloc or unwritten
buffers and fix the spurious warnings by warning only if the page is
clean.
