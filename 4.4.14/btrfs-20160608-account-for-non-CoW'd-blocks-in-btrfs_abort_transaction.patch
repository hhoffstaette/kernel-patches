Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: account for non-CoW'd blocks in btrfs_abort_transaction
Date:	Wed, 8 Jun 2016 00:36:38 -0400

The test for !trans->blocks_used in btrfs_abort_transaction is
insufficient to determine whether it's safe to drop the transaction
handle on the floor.  btrfs_cow_block, informed by should_cow_block,
can return blocks that have already been CoW'd in the current
transaction.  trans->blocks_used is only incremented for new block
allocations. If an operation overlaps the blocks in the current
transaction entirely and must abort the transaction, we'll happily
let it clean up the trans handle even though it may have modified
the blocks and will commit an incomplete operation.

In the long-term, I'd like to do closer tracking of when the fs
is actually modified so we can still recover as gracefully as possible,
but that approach will need some discussion.  In the short term,
since this is the only code using trans->blocks_used, let's just
switch it to a bool indicating whether any blocks were used and set
it when should_cow_block returns false.
