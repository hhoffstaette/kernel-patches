Subject: [PATCH 6/7] btrfs: only ignore delalloc if delalloc is much smaller than ordered
Date:   Wed, 28 Apr 2021 13:38:47 -0400

While testing heavy delalloc workloads I noticed that sometimes we'd
just stop preemptively flushing when we had loads of delalloc available
to flush.  This is because we skip preemptive flushing if delalloc <=
ordered.  However if we start with say 4gib of delalloc, and we flush
2gib of that, we'll stop flushing there, when we still have 2gib of
delalloc to flush.

Instead adjust the ordered bytes down by half, this way if 2/3 of our
outstanding delalloc reservations are tied up by ordered extents we
don't bother preemptive flushing, as we're getting close to the state
where we need to wait on ordered extents.
