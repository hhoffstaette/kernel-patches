Thanks for the report, I've condensed this down to the following:

#!/bin/bash

SCRATCH_MNT=/mnt
LOAD_FACTOR=1
TIME_FACTOR=1

mkfs.xfs -f /dev/sda
mount /dev/sda $SCRATCH_MNT

mkdir $SCRATCH_MNT/lowerdir
mkdir $SCRATCH_MNT/lowerdir1
mkdir $SCRATCH_MNT/lowerdir/etc
mkdir $SCRATCH_MNT/workers
echo salts > $SCRATCH_MNT/lowerdir/etc/access.conf
touch $SCRATCH_MNT/running

stop_workers() {
	test -e $SCRATCH_MNT/running || return
	rm -f $SCRATCH_MNT/running

	while [ "$(ls $SCRATCH_MNT/workers/ | wc -l)" -gt 0 ]; do
		wait
	done
}

worker() {
	local tag="$1"
	local mergedir="$SCRATCH_MNT/merged$tag"
	local l="lowerdir=$SCRATCH_MNT/lowerdir:$SCRATCH_MNT/lowerdir1"
	local u="upperdir=$SCRATCH_MNT/upperdir$tag"
	local w="workdir=$SCRATCH_MNT/workdir$tag"
	local i="index=off"

	touch $SCRATCH_MNT/workers/$tag
	while test -e $SCRATCH_MNT/running; do
		rm -rf $SCRATCH_MNT/merged$tag
		rm -rf $SCRATCH_MNT/upperdir$tag
		rm -rf $SCRATCH_MNT/workdir$tag
		mkdir $SCRATCH_MNT/merged$tag
		mkdir $SCRATCH_MNT/workdir$tag
		mkdir $SCRATCH_MNT/upperdir$tag

		mount -t overlay overlay -o "$l,$u,$w,$i" $mergedir
		mv $mergedir/etc/access.conf $mergedir/etc/access.conf.bak
		touch $mergedir/etc/access.conf
		mv $mergedir/etc/access.conf $mergedir/etc/access.conf.bak
		touch $mergedir/etc/access.conf
		umount $mergedir
	done
	rm -f $SCRATCH_MNT/workers/$tag
}

for i in $(seq 0 $((4 + LOAD_FACTOR)) ); do
	worker $i &
done

sleep $((30 * TIME_FACTOR))
stop_workers

...and I think this is enough to diagnose the deadlock.

This is an ABBA deadlock caused by locking the AGI buffers in the wrong
order.  Specifically, we seem to be calling xfs_dir_rename with a
non-null @wip and a non-null @target_ip.  In the deadlock scenario, @wip
is an inode in AG 2, and @target_ip is an inode in AG 0 with nlink==1.

First we call xfs_iunlink_remove to remove @wip from the unlinked list,
which causes us to lock AGI 2.  Next we replace the directory entry.
Finally, we need to droplink @target_ip.  Since @target_ip has nlink==1,
xfs_droplink will need to put it on AGI 0's unlinked list.

Unfortunately, the locking rules say that you can only lock AGIs in
increasing order.  This means that we cannot lock AGI 0 after locking
AGI 2 without risking deadlock.

Does the attached patch fix the deadlock for you?

Subject: [PATCH] xfs: fix an ABBA deadlock in xfs_rename

When overlayfs is running on top of xfs and the user unlinks a file in
the overlay, overlayfs will create a whiteout inode and ask xfs to
"rename" the whiteout file atop the one being unlinked.  If the file
being unlinked loses its one nlink, we then have to put the inode on the
unlinked list.

This requires us to grab the AGI buffer of the whiteout inode to take it
off the unlinked list (which is where whiteouts are created) and to grab
the AGI buffer of the file being deleted.  If the whiteout was created
in a higher numbered AG than the file being deleted, we'll lock the AGIs
in the wrong order and deadlock.

Therefore, grab all the AGI locks we think we'll need ahead of time, and
in the correct order.
