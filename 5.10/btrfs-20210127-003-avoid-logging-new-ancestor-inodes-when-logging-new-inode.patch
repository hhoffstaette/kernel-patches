Subject: [PATCH 3/7] btrfs: avoid logging new ancestor inodes when logging new inode
Date:   Wed, 27 Jan 2021 10:34:56 +0000

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

When we fsync a new file, created in the current transaction, we check
all its ancestor inodes and always log them if they were created in the
current transaction - even if we have already logged them before, which
is a waste of time.

So avoid logging new ancestor inodes if they were already logged before
and have no xattrs added/updated/removed since they were last logged.

This patch is part of a patchset comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: remove unnecessary directory inode item update when deleting dir entry
  btrfs: stop setting nbytes when filling inode item for logging
  btrfs: avoid logging new ancestor inodes when logging new inode
  btrfs: skip logging directories already logged when logging all parents
  btrfs: skip logging inodes already logged when logging new entries
  btrfs: remove unnecessary check_parent_dirs_for_sync()
  btrfs: make concurrent fsyncs wait less when waiting for a transaction commit

Performance results, after applying all patches, are mentioned in the
change log of the last patch.
