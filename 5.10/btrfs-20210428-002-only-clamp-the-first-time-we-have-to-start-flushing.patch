Subject: [PATCH 2/7] btrfs: only clamp the first time we have to start flushing
Date:   Wed, 28 Apr 2021 13:38:43 -0400

We were clamping the threshold for preemptive reclaim any time we added
a ticket to wait on, which if we have a lot of threads means we'd
essentially max out the clamp the first time we start to flush.  Instead
of doing this, simply do it every time we have to start flushing, this
will make us ramp up gradually instead of going to max clamping as soon
as we start needing to do flushing.
