Subject: block, bfq: make waker-queue detection more robust
Date: Mon, 25 Jan 2021 20:02:48 +0100

In the presence of many parallel I/O flows, the detection of waker
bfq_queues suffers from false positives. This commits addresses this
issue by making the filtering of actual wakers more selective. In more
detail, a candidate waker must be found to meet waker requirements
three times before being promoted to actual waker.

+ *
+ * A remarkable throughput boost can be reached by unconditionally

+ * injection mechanism, but less effectively. For details on this
+ * aspect, see the comments on the choice of the queue for injection
+ * in bfq_select_queue().
+ *
+ * Turning back to the detection of a waker queue, a queue Q is deemed
+ * as a waker queue for bfqq if, for three consecutive times, bfqq
+ * happens to become non empty right after a request of Q has been
+ * completed. In particular, on the first time, Q is tentatively set
+ * as a candidate waker queue, while on the third consecutive time
+ * that Q is detected, the field waker_bfqq is set to Q, to confirm
+ * that Q is a waker queue for bfqq. These detection steps are
+ * performed only if bfqq has a long think time, so as to make it more
+ * likely that bfqq's I/O is actually being blocked by a
+ * synchronization. This last filter, plus the above three-times
+ * requirement, make false positives less likely.
+ *
+ * NOTE
+ *
+ * The sooner a waker queue is detected, the sooner throughput can be
+ * boosted by injecting I/O from the waker queue. Fortunately,
+ * detection is likely to be actually fast, for the following
+ * reasons. While blocked by synchronization, bfqq has a long think
+ * time. This implies that bfqq's inject limit is at least equal to 1
+ * (see the comments in bfq_update_inject_limit()). So, thanks to
+ * injection, the waker queue is likely to be served during the very
+ * first I/O-plugging time interval for bfqq. This triggers the first
+ * step of the detection mechanism. Thanks again to injection, the
+ * candidate waker queue is then likely to be confirmed no later than
+ * during the next I/O-plugging interval for bfqq.
+ *
+ * ISSUE
