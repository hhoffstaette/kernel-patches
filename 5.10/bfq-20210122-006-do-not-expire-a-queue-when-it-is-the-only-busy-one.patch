Subject: [PATCH BUGFIX/IMPROVEMENT 6/6] block, bfq: do not expire a queue when it is the only busy one
Date: Fri, 22 Jan 2021 19:19:48 +0100

This commits preserves I/O-dispatch plugging for a special symmetric
case that may suddenly turn into asymmetric: the case where only one
bfq_queue, say bfqq, is busy. In this case, not expiring bfqq does not
cause any harm to any other queues in terms of service guarantees. In
contrast, it avoids the following unlucky sequence of events: (1) bfqq
is expired, (2) a new queue with a lower weight than bfqq becomes busy
(or more queues), (3) the new queue is served until a new request
arrives for bfqq, (4) when bfqq is finally served, there are so many
requests of the new queue in the drive that the pending requests for
bfqq take a lot of time to be served. In particular, event (2) may
case even already dispatched requests of bfqq to be delayed, inside
the drive. So, to avoid this series of events, the scenario is
preventively declared as asymmetric also if bfqq is the only busy
queues. By doing so, I/O-dispatch plugging is performed for bfqq.
