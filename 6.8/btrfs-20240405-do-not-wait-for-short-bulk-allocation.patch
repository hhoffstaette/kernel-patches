Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: do not wait for short bulk allocation
Date: Fri,  5 Apr 2024 08:13:11 +1030

[BUG]
There is a recent report that when memory pressure is high (including
cached pages), btrfs can spend most of its time on memory allocation in
btrfs_alloc_page_array() for compressed read/write.

[CAUSE]
For btrfs_alloc_page_array() we always go alloc_pages_bulk_array(), and
even if the bulk allocation failed (fell back to single page
allocation) we still retry but with extra memalloc_retry_wait().

If the bulk alloc only returned one page a time, we would spend a lot of
time on the retry wait.

The behavior was introduced in commit 395cb57e8560 ("btrfs: wait between
incomplete batch memory allocations").

[FIX]
Although the commit mentioned that other filesystems do the wait, it's
not the case at least nowadays.

All the mainlined filesystems only call memalloc_retry_wait() if they
failed to allocate any page (not only for bulk allocation).
If there is any progress, they won't call memalloc_retry_wait() at all.

For example, xfs_buf_alloc_pages() would only call memalloc_retry_wait()
if there is no allocation progress at all, and the call is not for
metadata readahead.

So I don't believe we should call memalloc_retry_wait() unconditionally
for short allocation.

This patch would only call memalloc_retry_wait() if failed to allocate
any page for tree block allocation (which goes with __GFP_NOFAIL and may
not need the special handling anyway), and reduce the latency for
btrfs_alloc_page_array().

Changelog:
v3:
- Remove wait part completely
  For NOFAIL metadata allocation, the allocation itself should not fail.
  For regular allocation, we can afford the failure anyway.

v2:
- Still use bulk allocation function
  Since alloc_pages_bulk_array() would fall back to single page
  allocation by itself, there is no need to go alloc_page() manually.

- Update the commit message to indicate other fses do not call
  memalloc_retry_wait() unconditionally
  In fact, they only call it when they need to retry hard and can not
  really fail.
