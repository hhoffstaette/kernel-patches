Subject: bfq: Relax waker detection for shared queues

Currently we look for waker only if current queue has no requests. This
makes sense for bfq queues with a single process however for shared
queues when there is a larger number of processes the condition that
queue has no requests is difficult to meet because often at least one
process has some request in flight although all the others are waiting
for the waker to do the work and this harms throughput. Relax the "no
queued request for bfq queue" condition to "the current task has no
queued requests yet". For this, we also need to start tracking number of
requests in flight for each task.

This patch (together with the following one) restores the performance
for dbench with 128 clients that regressed with commit c65e6fd460b4
("bfq: Do not let waker requests skip proper accounting") because
this commit makes requests of wakers properly enter BFQ queues and thus
these queues become ineligible for the old waker detection logic.
Dbench results:

         Vanilla 5.18-rc3        5.18-rc3 + revert      5.18-rc3 patched
Mean     1237.36 (   0.00%)      950.16 *  23.21%*      988.35 *  20.12%*

Numbers are time to complete workload so lower is better.

Fixes: c65e6fd460b4 ("bfq: Do not let waker requests skip proper accounting")
