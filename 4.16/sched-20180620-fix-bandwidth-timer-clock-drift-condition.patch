Subject: sched/fair: Fix bandwidth timer clock drift condition

I noticed that cgroup task groups constantly get throttled even
if they have low CPU usage, this causes some jitters on the response
time to some of our business containers when enabling CPU quotas.

It's very simple to reproduce:

  mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/test
  cd /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/test
  echo 100000 > cpu.cfs_quota_us
  echo $$ > tasks

then repeat:

  cat cpu.stat | grep nr_throttled  # nr_throttled will increase steadily

After some analysis, we found that cfs_rq::runtime_remaining will
be cleared by expire_cfs_rq_runtime() due to two equal but stale
"cfs_{b|q}->runtime_expires" after period timer is re-armed.

The current condition to judge clock drift in expire_cfs_rq_runtime()
is wrong, the two runtime_expires are actually the same when clock
drift happens, so this condtion can never hit. The orginal design was
correctly done by this commit:

  a9cf55b28610 ("sched: Expire invalid runtime")

... but was changed to be the current implementation due to its locking bug.

This patch introduces another way, it adds a new field in both structures
cfs_rq and cfs_bandwidth to record the expiration update sequence, and
uses them to figure out if clock drift happens (true if they are equal).
