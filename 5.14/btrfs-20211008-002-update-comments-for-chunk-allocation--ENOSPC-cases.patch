Subject: [PATCH v2 2/2] btrfs: update comments for chunk allocation -ENOSPC cases
Date:   Fri,  8 Oct 2021 16:10:35 +0100

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

Update the comments at btrfs_chunk_alloc() and do_chunk_alloc() that
describe which cases can lead to a failure to allocate metadata and system
space despite having previously reserved space. This adds one more reason
that I previously forgot to mention.
