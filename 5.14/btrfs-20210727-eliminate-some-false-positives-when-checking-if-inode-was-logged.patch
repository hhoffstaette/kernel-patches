Subject: btrfs: eliminate some false positives when checking if inode was logged

When checking if an inode was previously logged in the current transaction
through the helper inode_logged(), we can return some false positives that
can be easily eliminated. These correspond to the cases where an inode has
a ->logged_trans value that is not zero and its value is smaller then the
ID of the current transaction. This means we know exactly that the inode
was never logged before in the current transaction, so we can return false
and avoid the callers to do extra work:

1) Having btrfs_del_dir_entries_in_log() and btrfs_del_inode_ref_in_log()
   unnecessarily join a log transaction and do deletion searches in a log
   tree that will not find anything. This just adds unnecessary contention
   on extent buffer locks;

2) Having btrfs_log_new_name() unnecessarily log an inode when it is not
   needed. If the inode was not logged before, we don't need to log it in
   LOG_INODE_EXISTS mode.

So just make sure that any false positive only happens when ->logged_trans
has a value of 0.
