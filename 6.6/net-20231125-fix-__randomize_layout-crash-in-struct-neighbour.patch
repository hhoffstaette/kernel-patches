Subject: neighbour: Fix __randomize_layout crash in struct neighbour

Previously, one-element and zero-length arrays were treated as true
flexible arrays, even though they are actually "fake" flex arrays.
The __randomize_layout would leave them untouched at the end of the
struct, similarly to proper C99 flex-array members.

However, this approach changed with commit 1ee60356c2dc ("gcc-plugins:
randstruct: Only warn about true flexible arrays"). Now, only C99
flexible-array members will remain untouched at the end of the struct,
while one-element and zero-length arrays will be subject to randomization.

Fix a `__randomize_layout` crash in `struct neighbour` by transforming
zero-length array `primary_key` into a proper C99 flexible-array member.

Fixes: 1ee60356c2dc ("gcc-plugins: randstruct: Only warn about true flexible arrays")
