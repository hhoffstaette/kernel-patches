Subject: cpuidle: Fix cpuidle_state_is_coupled() argument in cpuidle_enter()

Commit 0b89e9aa2856 (cpuidle: delay enabling interrupts until all
coupled CPUs leave idle) rightfully fixed a regression by letting
the coupled idle state framework to handle local interrupt enabling
when the CPU is exiting an idle state.

The current code checks if the idle state is coupled and, if so, it
will let the coupled code to enable interrupts. This way, it can
decrement the ready-count before handling the interrupt. This
mechanism prevents the other CPUs from waiting for a CPU which is
handling interrupts.

But the check is done against the state index returned by the back
end driver's ->enter functions which could be different from the
initial index passed as parameter to the cpuidle_enter_state()
function.

 entered_state = target_state->enter(dev, drv, index);

 [ ... ]

 if (!cpuidle_state_is_coupled(drv, entered_state))
	local_irq_enable();

 [ ... ]

If the 'index' is referring to a coupled idle state but the
'entered_state' is *not* coupled, then the interrupts are enabled
again. All CPUs blocked on the sync barrier may busy loop longer
if the CPU has interrupts to handle before decrementing the
ready-count. That's consuming more energy than saving.
