Subject: btrfs: avoid attempt to drop extents when logging inode for the first time

When logging an extent, in the fast fsync path, we always attempt do drop
or trim any existing extents with a range that match or overlap the range
of the extent we are about to log. We do that through a call to
btrfs_drop_extents().

However this is not needed when we are logging the inode for the first
time in the current transaction, since we have no inode items of the
inode in the log tree. Calling btrfs_drop_extents() does a deletion search
on the log tree, which is expensive when we have concurrent tasks
accessing the log tree because a deletion search always acquires a write
lock on the extent buffers at levels 2, 1 and 0, adding significant lock
contention, specially taking into account the height of a log tree rarely
(if ever) goes beyond 2 or 3, due to its short life.

So skip the call to btrfs_drop_extents() when the inode was not previously
logged in the current transaction.

This patch is part of a patch set comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: check if a log tree exists at inode_logged()
  btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log context
  btrfs: do not log new dentries when logging that a new name exists
  btrfs: always update the logged transaction when logging new names
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when dropping inode items from log
  btrfs: add helper to truncate inode items when logging inode
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when truncating inode items from the log
  btrfs: avoid search for logged i_size when logging inode if possible
  btrfs: avoid attempt to drop extents when logging inode for the first time
  btrfs: do not commit delayed inode when logging a file in full sync mode

This is patch 9/10 and test results are listed in the change log of the
last patch in the set.
