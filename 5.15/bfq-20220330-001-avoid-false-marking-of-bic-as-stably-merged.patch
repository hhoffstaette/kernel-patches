Subject: [PATCH 1/9] bfq: Avoid false marking of bic as stably merged
Date: Wed, 30 Mar 2022 14:42:44 +0200

bfq_setup_cooperator() can mark bic as stably merged even though it
decides to not merge its bfqqs (when bfq_setup_merge() returns NULL).
Make sure to mark bic as stably merged only if we are really going to
merge bfqqs.
