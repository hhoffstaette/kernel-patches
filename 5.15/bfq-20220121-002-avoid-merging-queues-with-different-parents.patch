Subject: [PATCH 2/4] bfq: Avoid merging queues with different parents
Date: Fri, 21 Jan 2022 11:56:43 +0100

It can happen that the parent of a bfqq changes between the moment we
decide two queues are worth to merge (and set bic->stable_merge_bfqq)
and the moment bfq_setup_merge() is called. This can happen e.g. because
the process submitted IO for a different cgroup and thus bfqq got
reparented. It can even happen that the bfqq we are merging with has
parent cgroup that is already offline and going to be destroyed in which
case the merge can lead to use-after-free issues such as:

Fix the problem by checking that the parent of the two bfqqs we are
merging in bfq_setup_merge() is the same.
