Subject: [PATCH] xfs: check sb_meta_uuid for dabuf buffer recovery
Date:   Thu, 16 Dec 2021 11:17:09 +1100

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

Got a report that a repeated crash test of a container host would
eventually fail with a log recovery error preventing the system from
mounting the root filesystem. It manifested as a directory leaf node
corruption on writeback like so:

 XFS (loop0): Mounting V5 Filesystem
 XFS (loop0): Starting recovery (logdev: internal)
 XFS (loop0): Metadata corruption detected at xfs_dir3_leaf_check_int+0x99/0xf0, xfs_dir3_leaf1 block 0x12faa158
 XFS (loop0): Unmount and run xfs_repair
 XFS (loop0): First 128 bytes of corrupted metadata buffer:

 XFS (loop0): log mount failed

Tracing indicated that we were recovering changes from a transaction
at LSN 0x29/0x1c16 into a buffer that had an LSN of 0x29/0x1d57.
That is, log recovery was overwriting a buffer with newer changes on
disk than was in the transaction. Tracing indicated that we were
hitting the "recovery immediately" case in
xlog_recover_get_buf_lsn(), and hence it was ignoring the LSN in the
buffer.

The code was extracting the LSN correctly, then ignoring it because
the UUID in the buffer did not match the superblock UUID. The
problem arises because the UUID check uses the wrong UUID - it
should be checking the sb_meta_uuid, not sb_uuid. This filesystem
has sb_uuid != sb_meta_uuid (which is fine), and the buffer has the
correct matching sb_meta_uuid in it, it's just the code checked it
against the wrong superblock uuid.

The is no corruption in the filesystem, and failing to recover the
buffer due to a write verifier failure means the recovery bug did
not propagate the corruption to disk. Hence there is no corruption
before or after this bug has manifested, the impact is limited
simply to an unmountable filesystem....

This was missed back in 2015 during an audit of incorrect sb_uuid
usage that resulted in commit fcfbe2c4ef42 ("xfs: log recovery needs
to validate against sb_meta_uuid") that fixed the magic32 buffers to
validate against sb_meta_uuid instead of sb_uuid. It missed the
magicda buffers....
