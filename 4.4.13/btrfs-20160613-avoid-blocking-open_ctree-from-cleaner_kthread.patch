Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: avoid blocking open_ctree from cleaner_kthread
Date:	Sun, 12 Jun 2016 23:39:58 -0400

This fixes a problem introduced in commit 2f3165ecf103599f82bf0ea254039db335fb5005
"btrfs: don't force mounts to wait for cleaner_kthread to delete one or more subvolumes".

open_ctree eventually calls btrfs_replay_log which in turn calls
btrfs_commit_super which tries to lock the cleaner_mutex, causing a
recursive mutex deadlock during mount.

Instead of playing whack-a-mole trying to keep up with all the
functions that may want to lock cleaner_mutex, put all the cleaner_mutex
lockers back where they were, and attack the problem more directly:
keep cleaner_kthread asleep until the filesystem is mounted.

When filesystems are mounted read-only and later remounted read-write,
open_ctree did not set fs_info->open and neither does anything else.
Set this flag in btrfs_remount so that neither btrfs_delete_unused_bgs
nor cleaner_kthread get confused by the common case of "/" filesystem
read-only mount followed by read-write remount.
